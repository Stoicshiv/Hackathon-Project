# Hackathon-Project
The primary objective of this project is to create an affordable and practical water usage tracker for households. The system collects data on water levels in the tank, logs it with accurate timestamps, and outputs it to the Serial Monitor, which can later be analyzed and used for improving water conservation strategies..
