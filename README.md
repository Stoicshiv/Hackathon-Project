# Hackathon-Project
The primary objective of this project is to create an affordable and practical water usage tracker for households. The system collects data on water levels in the tank, logs it with accurate timestamps, and outputs it to the Serial Monitor, which can later be analyzed and used for improving water conservation strategies..
Components Used:
Arduino Board (i.e., Arduino Uno)
Water Level Sensor (Analog)
Jumper Wires
Power Supply (USB)
MicroSD Card (optional for data logging)
Features:
Real-time Monitoring: The system continuously monitors the water level in the tank, providing instant feedback on the water status.
Data Logging: Data is logged with a timestamp that includes the day, date, and time to allow easy tracking of water levels over time.
Water Usage Insights: The system provides users with an understanding of their water usage, allowing them to make informed decisions on water conservation.
Cost-effective and Easy to Build: The setup uses basic, inexpensive components, making it an affordable solution for households.
Working Mechanism:
The water level sensor is connected to the Arduino board and is placed in the water tank to measure the water level. The sensor outputs an analog signal based on the water height.
The Arduino reads this analog signal and converts it into a value between 0 and 1023, which corresponds to the water level.
The system also tracks the date and time using a simple timer and logs the readings to the Serial Monitor.
The output is displayed in a day, date, time (HH:MM:SS:MS) format, followed by the water level value.
Applications:
Household Water Conservation: The project helps homeowners keep track of their water usage and avoid overflows or water wastage.
for contribution :
Software Development (Arduino/Embedded Programming):
How they can contribute:
Others with programming experience can help improve the Arduino code, optimize data collection, or add new features such as notifications or automation based on water levels.
They could also help write a more robust, scalable version of the code that can handle multiple sensors or integrate with cloud platforms.
Skills Needed:
Arduino C/C++ programming, embedded system development.
